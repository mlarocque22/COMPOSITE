# COMPOSITE
Different Codes to merge text files from the other screens I have created


Composite_Exchange.py merges NYSE.txt and NASDAQ.txt into 1 text file

Composite_Industry.py merges any of the Industry text files from the NASDAQ and the NYSE into one texdt file

Composite_SO.py merges the penny options and penny stock files into one file
